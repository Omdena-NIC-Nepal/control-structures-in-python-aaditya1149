In this assignment, you will work through a series of exercises to test your understanding of Python control structures like `while`, `for`, and `if` statements, including the use of `break` and `continue` statements. Your task is to implement the provided starter code and ensure your solutions meet the requirements.\n","\n","### Part 1: Looping Constructs\n","\n","#### Task 1: `while` loop\n","- Write a `while` loop that prints all the even numbers from 0 to 20.\n","- If the number reaches 16, break out of the loop."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V_9FkzlUT4Pq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739115406013,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":45,"user":{"displayName":"Aaditya Thakur","userId":"17676091389827832509"}},"outputId":"4933e20c-a939-4a45-a58b-3510743c9eba"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\n","2\n","4\n","6\n","8\n","10\n","12\n","14\n"]}],"source":["# Task 1: while loop\n","number = 0\n","while number <= 20:\n","  if number == 16:\n","    break\n","  if number % 2 == 0:\n","    print(number)\n","  number+=1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GL5ArCOuT4Pu"},"source":["#### Task 2: `for` loop with `continue`\n","- Write a `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to 15.\n","- If the number is divisible by 3, skip printing it using the `continue` statement.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1sDKXneuT4Pw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739115666879,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Aaditya Thakur","userId":"17676091389827832509"}},"outputId":"baca1e98-80c2-4e6e-c576-21ef4ebe9f95"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1\n","2\n","4\n","5\n","7\n","8\n","10\n","11\n","13\n","14\n"]}],"source":["# Task 2: for loop with continue\n","for num in range(1, 16):\n","    if num % 3 == 0:\n","      continue\n","    print(num)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-U_7RTd8T4Py"},"source":["#### Task 3: `if-else` statement\n","- Write an `if-else` statement that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.\n","- Print an appropriate message for each case."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"oE9OEL4sT4Py"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Task 3: if-else statement\n","number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","if number == 0:\n","  print(\"Number is zero.\")\n","elif number > 0:\n","  print(\"Number is positive.\")\n","else:\n","  print(\"Number is negative.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YX5SZyQET4Pz"},"source":["#### Task 4: Nested loops\n","- Write a program that uses nested loops to print a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"M_tFhs8jT4P0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739116138830,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Aaditya Thakur","userId":"17676091389827832509"}},"outputId":"6e444d9d-d5be-4b9f-8c68-83c34e87663a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","2\n","4\n","6\n","8\n","10\n","3\n","6\n","9\n","12\n","15\n","4\n","8\n","12\n","16\n","20\n","5\n","10\n","15\n","20\n","25\n"]}],"source":["# Task 4: Nested loops\n","for i in range(1, 6):\n","    for j in range(1, 6):\n","        print (i*j)\n",""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"41ijJ8-aT4P1"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
